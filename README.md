I started with my original website and made several improvements to make it more professional, interactive, and user-friendly while keeping the design I liked. I added JavaScript enhancements to make the pages dynamic, including a searchable services section, a lightbox gallery for images, a FAQ accordion, and an interactive map showing our service area. I also created an enquiry form and improved the contact form, adding client-side validation and an option to send messages via email. All pages now have **consistent styling through the CSS. For better SEO, I included meta tags, structured data, and added `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` to help search engines index the site. Overall, the changes make my website look more polished, easier to use, and ready for visitors while keeping the layout and style I originally created.
